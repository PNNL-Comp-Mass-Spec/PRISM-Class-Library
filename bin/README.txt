This is the PRISM Class file distribution package.
It contains:

PRISM.dll  - the library of code
PRISM.xml  - the stuff that makes Intellisense work in Visual Studio
README.txt - this file

Drop the DLL and XML files into your project folder.
The DLL and XML files need to be together for Intellisense to work properly.
Add a reference to the DLL to your project.
